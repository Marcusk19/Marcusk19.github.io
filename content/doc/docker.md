According to [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/))...

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

However, this definition didn't clear things up for me when I was learning about Docker. For context, at the time I had no idea how code was packaged or shipped - not to mention what the benefits of Docker are.



## Containers

To better understand what Docker does, an understanding of what containers are is needed. Putting it simply, containers can be thought of packages containing an application and all its dependencies required to run. Containers are oftentimes compared to virtual machines, but there are a few key distinctions to be made between them.



| Containers                                                                  | Virtual Machines                                      |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| More lightweight, only contain the bare minimum required to run a program . | Heavier, as it simulates hardware unlike a container. |
