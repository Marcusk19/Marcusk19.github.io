My reason for doing so was:
Previously I had installed Arch on my old laptop and enjoyed the experience of having complete control over my OS I’ve found that recently I’ve been spending less time playing games on my desktop and with the recent release of the Steam Deck it seemed like the right time for me to jump ship.</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot Wordle</title><link>https://marcusk19.github.io/mywebsite/posts/springwordle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:57:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcusk19.github.io/mywebsite/posts/springwordle/</guid><description>I’ve wanted to build a web-app using Java and the recently popular game “Wordle” looked easy to replicate in my own way. The original Wordle game itself was only a Javascript file for most of the logic.
