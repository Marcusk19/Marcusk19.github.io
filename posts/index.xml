It makes it easy to change the look, theme, and content of your site. However, it comes with a few inconveniences that I have noticed during these last months:
Wordpress comes with a lot of bloat. Things like SEO optimization and OptinMonster, which may be relevant to other people but not for my uses.
Forms that allowed comments underneath my posts led to a few bots spamming me.</description></item><item><title>Single GPU passthrough with AMD build</title><link>https://marcuskok.com/posts/singlegpu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 21:57:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcuskok.com/posts/singlegpu/</guid><description>Recently I made the move to Arch Linux as the daily driver for my gaming rig. My reason for doing so was:
Previously I had installed Arch on my old laptop and enjoyed the experience of having complete control over my OS I’ve found that recently I’ve been spending less time playing games on my desktop and with the recent release of the Steam Deck it seemed like the right time for me to jump ship.</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot Wordle</title><link>https://marcuskok.com/posts/springwordle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:57:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcuskok.com/posts/springwordle/</guid><description>I’ve wanted to build a web-app using Java and the recently popular game “Wordle” looked easy to replicate in my own way. The original Wordle game itself was only a Javascript file for most of the logic. However, I took this as a chance to learn some basics of Spring Boot and build a proper web-application based on the game.
File structure of my project
The Wordle Class Getting started was simple enough thanks to the Spring Initializr extension installed on my VScode.</description></item><item><title>Log4shell</title><link>https://marcuskok.com/posts/log4shell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 08:47:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://marcuskok.com/posts/log4shell/</guid><description>A couple weeks ago a zero-day vulnerability was exposed on servers running the game Minecraft.

When I discovered Pi-hole, a dns level ad-blocker that supposedly could block ads for all devices on my home network, I was instantly intrigued. I immediately bought an affordable Raspberry Pi Zero W with the end goal of having my own pi-hole on my network.
Setting up the Pi To begin, I first had to flash an iso image for my desired operating system to my Pi.</description></item></channel></rss>
